Here, you'll find my scores for various DataCamp assessments I've taken as a way to showcase my technical ability. If a skill is present on my resume, but no assessment is shown, it means DataCamp did not offer an assessment for that particular skill, or I have not gotten around to taking it yet. 

These assessments are adaptive and get harder the more questions that are answered correctly.
